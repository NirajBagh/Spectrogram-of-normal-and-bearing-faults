Data presented here were collected for - Bearings Fault Diagnosis

1. normal bearings,
2. single-point drive end
3. fan end defects.

Data collected at 12,000 samples/second and at 48,000 samples/second for drive end bearing experiments.
All fan end bearing data was collected at 12,000 samples/second.

Data files are in Matlab format.
Each file contains -

fan and
drive end vibration data as well as
motor rotational speed.
For all files, the following item in the variable name indicates:
